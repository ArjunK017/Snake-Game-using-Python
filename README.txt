		                                                            The Snake Game


 The Snake game is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by users for decades. The objective of the game is to control a snake and guide it to  eat the food while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to navigate through   the game board.
 
 This implementation of ‘The Snake game’ is built by using Python programming language and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. 
 
 The Main Purpose of this project are as follows: - 
 
  1. To provide an engaging and entertaining game that demonstrates the use of python programming and graphical user interface design. 
  2. It also teaches learners important software concepts such as problem solving, collaboration etc. 
  3. It also helps learners to develop programming skills. 
  4. Ensure a smooth and responsive gaming experience.
  5. Incorporate a scoring system and display the player's score during gameplay.
  6. Handle user input effectively to control the snake's movement.
